# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I first used the Marvel API and it wasnt working
I then used the Super Heros API and it was blocked
I am now us the current API and its saying its bloced as well. I used Postman and the API for the tv shows ran fine. I dont have time to continue with researching and switching because its due it a few minutes. 
I am currently using react to create this project. I have my component pages that are all link with index css and app cc. I added all my packages. My api is blocked.
I Used Examples from class examples, I researched on youtube, and googled come error codes.
